# steam_analysis

## Dataset
Dataset located on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset/data)

## Purpose
Do some initial EDA and see where I can go with this dataset

I will probably
- pull game pricing data to see how the most popular game's sales have been over the years
- do clustering to see how "brand name" games perform compared to "indie" games
- pull game reviews for the most popular games and perform sentiment analysis
